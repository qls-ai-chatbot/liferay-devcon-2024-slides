In our session, we explore the transformative potential of integrating generative AI technologies with Liferay for a more interactive and intelligent user experience. We'll discuss implementing semantic search within Liferay using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. By leveraging Local Large Language Models (LLMs), we'll show how businesses can securely utilize private data to unlock insights and enhance engagement. Weâ€™ll also review client extensions benefits for implementation.
